Based on the Lucia example analysis, here are the remaining improvements we should make:

  Security & Cryptographic Validation

  1. Add proper WebAuthn signature verification
    - Install and use @oslojs/webauthn for parsing attestation objects and authenticator data
    - Implement real cryptographic signature verification during authentication
    - Parse and validate client data JSON properly
  2. Add proper public key extraction and storage
    - Extract actual public keys from attestation objects during registration
    - Store algorithm IDs alongside public keys
    - Use proper COSE key parsing for ES256/RS256 algorithms

  Database Schema Improvements

  3. Separate passkeys from security keys
    - Create distinct tables/handling for passkeys vs security keys
    - Different authenticator selection criteria for each type
  4. Store proper credential metadata
    - Add algorithm_id field to store COSE algorithm identifier
    - Store actual public keys instead of raw attestation objects
    - Add credential counter for replay attack protection

  Challenge Management

  5. Implement dedicated challenge endpoint
    - Create /api/webauthn/challenge endpoint separate from begin flows
    - Add proper rate limiting to challenge generation
    - Centralize challenge creation and validation
  6. Add comprehensive rate limiting
    - Rate limit challenge requests per IP
    - Rate limit authentication attempts per user
    - Implement exponential backoff for failed attempts

  Code Organization & Architecture

  7. Add proper error handling and logging
    - Implement structured logging for WebAuthn operations
    - Better error messages and error categorization
    - Handle edge cases and browser compatibility issues
  8. Add host/origin validation
    - Validate RP ID matches expected domain
    - Verify origin in client data JSON
    - Add environment-specific configuration

  Additional Security Features

  9. Add credential management features
    - Allow users to name/rename their passkeys
    - Show last used timestamps
    - Enable passkey deletion/management
  10. Add 2FA integration
    - Support passkeys as 2FA method alongside TOTP
    - Recovery code support for passkey-only accounts
    - Proper session management with 2FA verification flags

  Performance & Reliability

  11. Add proper transaction handling
    - Wrap database operations in transactions
    - Handle race conditions properly
    - Add proper cleanup of expired challenges
  12. Add user enumeration protection
    - Consistent timing for valid/invalid emails
    - Generic error messages that don't leak user existence

  The most critical missing pieces are proper signature verification and real public key storage - our current
  implementation is essentially just storing credentials without actually validating their authenticity, which
  is a major security vulnerability.
